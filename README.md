🚀 **Introducing CF Buddy: Your Ultimate Codeforces Companion!** 🚀

Competitive programming isn’t just about solving problems—it’s about tracking progress, analyzing performance, and learning from every contest. That’s why I built CF Buddy, a Codeforces utility app that helps you stay ahead in the game!

🔍 What can CF Buddy do?

✨ **Profile Section**:\n
🔹 Track your rating, recent contest performance, and activity info\n
🔹 Analyze your momentum meter to see your progress trend\n
\n
📅 **Contests**:\n
🔹 View the upcoming contest calendar so you never miss a challenge\n
🔹 Analyze your finished contest performance\n
🔹 Compare your ranking with friends using the friend ranklist\n
\n
👥 **Friends**:\n
🔹 Peek into friends' profiles, submissions, and stats\n
\n
📊 **Submissions & Stats**:\n
🔹 Monitor your submissions efficiently\n
🔹 Dive deep into contest-wise, submission-wise, problem rating-wise, and problem tag-wise analytics\n
\n
💡 **Tech Stack**:\n
🔹 Frontend: Flutter, Provider\n
🔹 Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB\n
🔹 API: Codeforces API\n
\n
🚧 **Challenges & Future Improvements**:\n
One of the biggest challenges was fetching all friends' handles together, as Codeforces doesn’t provide a bulk API. Currently, profiles load individually, but I’m actively working on optimizing this!\n
